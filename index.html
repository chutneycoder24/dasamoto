    <h3>Hacksaw Brushes</h3>
    <p>Made of the highest quality oak, Hacksaw brushes are known for their weight and ability
      to hold pain in large amounts. Available in different sizes. <span class="blue">Starting at $3.00 / brush.</span></p>
      <!-- Interesting choice to style your span inline. I would recommend avoiding
      inline styling at all costs. It can sometimes make things messy and difficult
      to work with down the line. And in this case, I think it's a bit inefficient.
      See how you've written the same code 3 separate times? You could have given the blue
      text spans a class and then styled them all at once. -->
